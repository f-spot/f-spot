Patches
-------

If you have a patch you'd like to submit, please open an issue describing your
fix or feature on https://github.com/f-spot/f-spot, and submit a pull request.
The selection below describes how to do so:

1. Fork the f-spot git repository by clicking on the "Fork" button on
https://github.com/f-spot/f-spot.
2. Clone your fork of f-spot locally. (git clone git@github.com:yourusername/f-spot)
3. Create a new branch for your bug fix or feature (git checkout -b new_branch_name)
4. Commit your changes to that branch (git commit)
5. Push your changes (git push)
6. Create a Pull Request (PR) with a reference to the issue and a description of
   the changes

We will review the patch, but if people are busy it might not happen right
away.

In the past we'd been doing patch review on the mailing list, but that hasn't
always worked very well.  Sometimes patches get lost in the shuffle.

Coding Style
------------

F-Spot attempts to follow the Mono coding conventions.  The following
description of those conventions was shamelessly stolen from Beagle's
HACKING file.

* Tagging buggy code

        If there is a bug in your implementation tag the problem by using
        the word "FIXME" in the code, together with a description of the 
        problem.

        Do not use XXX or TODO or obscure descriptions, because
        otherwise people will not be able to understand what you mean.


* Basic code formatting

        In order to keep the code consistent, please use the following
        conventions.  From here on `good' and `bad' are used to attribute
        things that would make the coding style match, or not match.  It is not
        a judgement call on your coding abilities, but more of a style and 
        look call.  Please follow these guidelines to ensure prettiness.

        Use tabs for indentation, not spaces.

        Since many are using 8-space tabs, you might want to consider the Linus
        Torvalds trick to reduce code nesting.  Many times in a loop, you will
        find yourself doing a test, and if the test is true, you will
        nest.  Many times this can be changed.  Example:


                for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                        if (Something (i)) {
                                DoMore ();
                        }
                }

        This take precious space, instead write it like this:

                for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                        if (! Something (i))
                                continue;
                        DoMore ();
                }

        A few guidelines:

                * Use a space before an opening parenthesis when calling
                  functions, or indexing, like this:

                        Method (a);
                        b [10];

                * Do not put a space after the opening parenthesis and the 
                  closing one, ie:

                        good: Method (a);       array [10];

                        bad:  Method ( a );     array[ 10 ];

                * Inside a code block, put the opening brace on the same line
                  as the statement:

                        good:
                                if (a) {
                                        Code ();
                                        Code ();
                                }

                        bad:
                                if (a) 
                                {
                                        Code ();
                                        Code ();
                                }

                * Avoid using unecessary open/close braces, vertical space
                  is usually limited:

                        good:
                                if (a)
                                        Code ();

                        bad:
                                if (a) {
                                        Code ();
                                }

                * When defining a method, use the C style for brace placement, 
                  that means, use a new line for the brace, like this:

                        good:
                                void Method ()
                                {
                                }

                        bad:
                                void Method () {
                                }

                * Properties and indexers are an exception, keep the
                  brace on the same line as the property declaration.
                  Rationale: this makes it visually
                  simple to distinguish them.

                        good:
                                int Property {
                                        get {
                                                return value;
                                        }
                                }

                        bad:
                                int Property 
                                {
                                        get {
                                                return value;
                                        }
                                }

                  Notice how the accessor "get" also keeps its brace on the same
                  line.

                  For very small properties, you can compress things:

                        ok:
                                int Property {
                                        get { return value; }
                                        set { x = value; }
                                }

                * Use white space in expressions liberally, except in the presence
                  of parenthesis:

                        good:

                                if (a + 5 > Method (Blah () + 4))

                        bad:
                                if (a+5>Method(Blah()+4))

                * For any new files, please use a descriptive introduction, like
                  this:

                        //
                        // System.Comment.cs: Handles comments in System files.
                        //
                        // Author:
                        //   Juan Perez (juan@address.com)
                        //
                        // (C) 2002 Address, Inc (http://www.address.com)
                        //

                * Switch statements have the case at the same indentation as the
                  switch:

                        switch (x) {
                        case 'a':
                                ...
                        case 'b':
                                ...
                        }

		* Private variable and function local variable names are under_scored 
		  (no camelCase please).

If you are using Emacs, you might want to put something like this
in your .emacs file:

(defun poor-mans-csharp-mode ()
  (java-mode)
  (setq mode-name "C#")
  (set-variable 'tab-width 8)
  (set-variable 'indent-tabs-mode t)
  (set-variable 'c-basic-offset 8)
  (c-set-offset 'inline-open 0)
  (c-set-offset 'case-label 0)
)

(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.cs\\'" . poor-mans-csharp-mode))
			      auto-mode-alist))




Unit Tests
----------

Unit tests using Nunit should follow a very simple structure.
// Arrange
// Act
// Assert
