To compile, just go through the normal autogen/configure stuff and
then make install.

To launch F-Spot, run $(prefix)/bin/f-spot.


With MonoDevelop:
  If you want to use MonoDevelop to build and run F-Spot here are notes about that process.

	There are a few steps you have to run before you can open MonoDevelop:
		1.  sh autogen.sh (on ubuntu you have to do ./autogen.sh)
		2.  cd build; make
		3.  cd lib/libfspot; make
		4.  sudo make install (this will install the libfspot.so files)

	This will build a couple tools in ./build that are needed to build the projects
	in ./lib.  Unfortunately, the f-spot.exe.config file points to whatever prefix
	you gave during 'sh autogen.sh'.  You could copy the files from 
	./lib/libfspot/.libs to ./bin and edit f-spot.exe.config, but it'll get
	overwritten with each build.

	Once these two directories are built you can now open monodevelop and build
	and run f-spot from there.
