# Installing missing Certificates

On distributions like Fedora or Mageia, Mono installations come without root certificates installed, and those may not necessarily be synced from the local root certificates as a post installation step either.
So on a fresh install, you may need to use the `cert-sync` tool in order to sync your local root certificates into the Mono truststore

More details in the [Mono 3.12 Release Notes](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/releases/3.12.0/#cert-sync)

To invoke the tool manually use

```bash
sudo cert-sync /path/to/ca-bundle.crt
```

On Debian systems, that’s

```bash
sudo cert-sync /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

and on Red Hat derivatives (Fedora, CentOS, Mageia, etc...) it’s

```bash
sudo cert-sync /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```

Your distribution might use a different path, if it’s not derived from one of those.

# Build

To compile, just go through the normal `autogen/configure` stuff and
then `make install`.

# Launch

To launch F-Spot, run `$(prefix)/bin/f-spot`.

# With MonoDevelop

If you want to use <IDE> to build and run F-Spot here are notes about that process.

There are a few steps you have to run before you can open MonoDevelop:

	1.  ./autogen.sh (on ubuntu you have to do ./autogen.sh)
	2.  cd build; make
	3.  cd lib/libfspot; make
	4.  sudo make install (this will install the libfspot.so files)

OR

	1. ./prep_linux_build.sh prefix={some/path}

I like to do `~/staging`

This will build a couple tools in ./build that are needed to build the projects in ./lib.

Once these two directories are built you can now open <IDE> and build and run f-spot from there.
