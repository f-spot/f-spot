             + Canon cameras: black level is not subtracted if set 
               params.document_mode > 1

           * API changed: params.gamma_16bit field removed. Gamma curve is
             set via params.gamm[0]/gamm[1] values (see documentation and 
             samples for details)
           * LibRaw::identify() splitted to avoid MS VS2008 bug (too many 
             nested blocks)

           * Samples: dcraw_emu and mem_image samples supports new dcraw 
              16bit/gamma semantics:

           * More accurate types conversion in libraw_datastream.h 
           * New postprocessing parameter auto_bright_thr: set portion of 
             clipped pixels for auto brightening code (instead of 
             dcraw-derived hardcoded 1%)
           * -U  option for dcraw_emu sample sets auto_bright_thr parameter
           * all client code should be recompiled due to structures size

           * Black level was not calculated for Canon RAWs in
             some filtering modes

           * 4channels sample prints calculated black level
             (scaled if autoscaling used). 
             Also output file names for this sample now includes 
             color channel name (R/G/B/G2 or C/M/Y/G)

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Beta2

2009-02-09 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * You need to clean and recompile client code which
             uses LibRaw_*_datastream classes.

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha6

2009-01-30  Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * New data input framework is created. It is possible now to
             easyly implement your own data input interface for LibRaw
             (e.g. for reading RAW data from network data stream)
             
           * All older programs using previous LibRaw versions are
	     compatible at source code level.

           * LibRaw can read RAW data from memory buffer via
             new LibRaw::open_buffer() API call (implemented on top of
             new input framework). 
             This call used in sample application dcraw_emu and simple_dcraw
             (with -B command-line switch) to test new API.

           * Error handling callback functions now can be called with
             NULL filename passed (if underlying data stream object
             does not know file name).
             So, client error handling callbacks should work with NULL
             filename.

           * All client code should be recompiled

           * Imported dcraw 8.90/1.417:
              + Support for loading White Balance data from
                Sony ARW files edited with Sony IDC software.

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha5

2009-01-17 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Raw filtering mode LIBRAW_FILTERING_NOPOSTPROCESS has renamed
            to LIBRAW_FILTERING_NORAWCURVE for better reflect its purpose.
            This filtering_mode bit turns off tone curve applying on
            RAW data on bayer-pattern cameras with raw tone curve:
              + Adobe DNG (only RAW with bayer pattern)
              + Nikon compressed NEF
              + Some Kodak cameras
              + Sony A700/A900 (tone curve applied to 8-bit raws)

           * unprocessed_raw sample: added command-line key -N, this key
             turns on LIBRAW_FILTERING_NORAWCURVE filtering mode.

           * New scheme of Fuji RAW processing (introduced in 0.7-Alpha3)
             supports DNG files generated from Fuji RAF.
           
           * Imported dcraw 8.90/1.416:
              + better support for Samsung S85
              + fixed possible integer overflow in wavelet denoising code

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha4


2009-01-14 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Black mask extraction supported for all files with bayer data
            (one component per pixel). Black mask data not avaliable
            for multi-component data (Foveon, Canon sRAW, Sinar 4-shot,
            Kodak YCC/YRGB).

           * Black level subtraction can be turned off for all bayer
            cameras (added support for PhaseOne backs).

           * Fujifilm camera processing model changed:
              + RAW data is extracted without 45-degree rotation
              + dcraw-compatible rotation is performed on postptocessing stage
              + it is possible to rotate RAW data without postprocessing
                by LibRaw::rotate_fuji_raw() call.

           * New filtering mode setting: LIBRAW_FILTERING_NOPOSTPROCESS
             This bits turns off RAW tone curve processing based on tone curve
             readed from RAW metadata.
             This mode supported only for PhaseOne backs now (to be supported
             on all relevant cameras in nearest future releases)

           * Black level data (got from RAW data) are stored for PhaseOne backs.

           * Black level subtraction bug (derived from dcraw) fixed
             for PhaseOne files.

           * Fixed processing of -s parameter for dcraw_emu sample
           
           * Parameter  -s N (select shot number) added to 
             unprocessed_raw sample.

           * Imported dcraw 8.90/1.414:
              + changes in QuickTake 100 metadata processing
              + changes in external jpeg processing code
              + Samsung S85 support

           * All client code should be recompiled

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha3 released

2009-01-10 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in add_masked_borders: crash if output dimensions
            is already larger than raw dimensions
            * Fixed out of bounds in samples/unprocessed_raw.cpp for files
            with non-square pixels

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha2 released
           
2009-01-08 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in  0.7.0-a0: black frame size has not reset, 
             so in batch processing there is an error in black frame
             size for files without black frame.

           * Implemented reading of black/masked pixels data for 
             near all cameras with masked pixels, exclding:
              + Canon sRAW, Leaf (MOS), Sinar 4-shot - more than one 
                color component in black frame (redesign of black frame
                data structures required).
              + Fuji SuperCCD: need to design right methods of extraction 
                (should we rotate and resize black pixels as active ones??)

            * Tested for most dSLR data formats with masked pixels: 7 of 9
              untested formats are from old P&S cameras.

           * New call LibRaw::unpack_function_name() returns unpack function name
             (useful for testers only)

           * New identify sample parameters (useful for test-suite builders
             to check test coverage):
                  -u - print unpack function name
                  -f - print masked frame size
             These parameters works only for identify run without -v parameter

           * Imported dcraw 8.89/1.411
             + changes in Panasonic FZ50 files parsing

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha1 released


2009-01-05 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * It is possible to turn off RAW data filtration (black level 
             subtraction,              zero pixels averaging):
                + supported on all cameras except Foveon and Phase One
                + filtraction controlled by new parameter "filtering_mode"
                + it is possible to expand API by filtering procedures 
                  built for specific camera model.

           * Black border (masked pixels) extraction:
                + API (data structures) for storing black mask.
                + Black mask extraction supported only for limited list of
                  data formats: 
                       - Canon .CRW, .CR2 (with exception of sRAW),A600, A5
                       - Adobe DNG (both converted RAW and native DNG)
                       - Nikon NEF (compressed only)
                  this list to be expanded in future LibRaw versions
           * New call add_masked_borders_to_bitmap makes full bitmap
             'masked border' + image
           * Usage sample for functionality listed above: 
              samples/unprocessed_raw 
           * Imported dcraw 8.89/1.410:
              + fixed bugs in Hasselblad .fff decoding
              + fixes in Imacon metadata decoding
           * Documentation changes
